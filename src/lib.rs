//! # Rusty Nature of Code
//!
//! `rusty_nature_of_code` is a project using rust, with the "RayLib" library and my own math library, miscmath, to follow along with Daniel Shiffman's "The Nature of Code" book
//! and his "The Nature of Code 2" video series on his YouTube channel "The Coding Train".
